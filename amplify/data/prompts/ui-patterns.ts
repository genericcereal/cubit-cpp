Common UI Patterns:
When asked to create screens or complex UI layouts, compose them using multiple elements.

For specific patterns and element combinations, see:
- frames.ts for container and layout patterns
- text.ts for text element usage within layouts
- nodes.ts for visual programming patterns
- edges.ts for connection patterns

Layout Guidelines:
- Use consistent spacing (16-24px) between elements
- Group related elements within containers
- Align elements properly based on their purpose
- Use appropriate sizes based on content
- Apply visual hierarchy through sizing and positioning

Build complex UIs by combining the basic element types according to their specific rules.`;
